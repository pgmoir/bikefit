    This {{result.options.gender}} rider, aged {{result.ageAtStart}} at the start of this year, in {{result.options.country}}
    will ride in category {{result.youthCategory}}. They are restricted to a rollout length of {{result.restrictionDistance}}m.
    The largest gear (chain ring) on the front has been specified as having {{result.options.largestChainRing}} teeth. <strong>The smallest cog on the rear cassette that can be made available on this bike should have {{result.smallestGear}}
    teeth</strong>. This is based on assumption that the tyre circumference for a {{result.options.rim}} wheel with {{result.options.tyre}}
    tyre will be {{result.tyreCircumference.toFixed(3)}}m, so the rollout on this gear will be {{result.rolloutDistance.toFixed(3)}}m.

    You can either adjust the limit screw on the rear cog to restrict gears (
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZK3qnz62zc" target="_new" class="alert-link">this helpful video shows you how</a>)
    or you can purchase a cassette that has the smallest gear to match the guidance above.

    again from the very helpful people at BTF Gear Restrictions (British Triathalon). The rollout is a very standard, global approach to checking restrictions on youth bikes. The actual
    distances permitted for age categories in different disciplines and countries will vary.
