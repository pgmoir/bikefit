      {{ restrictionDistance }}m. The largest gear on the front, also known as chain ring, has been specified as having
      {{ largestChainRing }}teeth. The smallest cog on the rear cassette that can be made available on
      this bike should have {{ smallestGear }} teeth. This is based on assumption that the tyre circumference
      for a {{ wheelSize }} wheel will be {{ tyreCircumference }}m, so the rollout on this gear will be
      {{ rolloutDistance.toFixed(3) }}m.</p> -->
