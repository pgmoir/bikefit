    will ride in category {{result.youthCategory}}. They are restricted to a rollout length of {{result.restrictionDistance}}m.
    The largest gear (chain ring) on the front has been specified as having {{result.options.largestChainRing}} teeth. <strong>The smallest cog on the rear cassette that can be made available on this bike should have {{result.smallestGear}}
    teeth</strong>. This is based on assumption that the tyre circumference for a {{result.options.rim}} wheel with {{result.options.tyre}}

    You can either adjust the limit screw on the rear cog to restrict gears (
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZK3qnz62zc" target="_new" class="alert-link">this helpful video shows you how</a>)
    or you can purchase a cassette that has the smallest gear to match our guidance.
